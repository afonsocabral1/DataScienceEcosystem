# # Data Science Tools and Ecosystem

# In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.

# **Objectives**
# 
#     - List popular languages for Data Science
#     - List commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists
#     - Outline 3 of the most widely used development environment tools in Data Science
#     - Provide some examples of arithmetic expressions used in Python.

# Some of the popular languages that Data Scientists use are:
#     
# 1. Python
# 2. R
# 3. SQL
# 4. JavaScript
# 5. Julia
# 6. Java
# 7. Scala
# 8. C++

# Some of the commonly used libraries used by Data Scientists include:
# 
# 1. Pandas
# 2. NumPy
# 3. Matplotlib
# 4. Seaborn
# 5. SciKit-Learn
# 6. Keras
# 7. TensorFlow
# 8. Pytorch

# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# Example 1: Finding the value of 4 to the power of 3:
# 
# x=pow(4,3)
# print(x)
# 
# 64
# 
# Example 2: Finding the multiplication of 2 numbers:
# 
# 2*3
# 
# 6
# 
# Example 3: Finding the subtraction of 2 numbers:
# 
# 4-1
# 
# 3

# In[2]:


# This is a simple arithmetic expression to multiply then add numbers.

(3*4)+5


# In[3]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

200/60
